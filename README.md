This project is a website that overviews my fictional story called DreamCrashers. Inside the project folder titled "DreamCrashers_Website" you will find 3 HTML files, 1 CSS file, 1 pdf, and an image folder. In order to open the website you can open any of the 3 HTML files in a browser, however I would start with index.html as that is the homepage.

Navaigation: On all three HTML page there is a navigation bar that contains links to the other pages.

index.html/Homepage: Contains a very brief description of the story at the top, a section of text that explains the concept of a story's "Supernature" and an explaination of DreamCrashers's Supernature, and the rest of the page explains important roles and elements of the story.

character.html/Characters: Goes over several important characters in the story, each character is at different stages of conceptualization or development, so each character description may be different than others in terms of what they focus on, such as abilities over backstory or personality.

gallery.html/Gallery: Contains images of some pages of the notebook I originally began writing about the story in, as well as an embarrassing painting I made of the main character. 

sitemap.pdf: Contains the sitemap, it isn't very in depth and I'm not sure if I went about it in the best way but it's how I knew to do it. Most modern browsers should be able to view it.

style.css: Contains code that dictates how the site looks.

images: A folder containing all of the images for the site, this includes the background image, favicon, and all images included in the gallery
