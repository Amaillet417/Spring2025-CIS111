            <p>DreamCrashers is a fictional story that follows a young man named Ethan Sterling, who is thrust into a supernatural world of monsters and entities born from the dreams of humanity.</p>
            <h2>Supernature: </h2>
            <p>If you look at a bunch of different stories with paranormal phenomonon you will find that they often have different rules or definitions of what the paranormal even is in their worlds, in one story the source of a supernatural power might be from practiced magic, in another it might be from a ghost, or it might be psychic. I call this aspect of fictional worlds it's Supernature. </p>
            <p>The Supernature of DreamCrashers comes from a glitch in the evolution of consciousness of life on earth that caused dreams to leak out of minds and form the Oneirosphere, which now connects all minds and influences reality, although most people are oblivious to this fact, and cannot see the strange things that happen when they are awake. However when a visible physical object is altered by the Oneirosphere, the alterations are visible, which is why an ordinary person can witness Ethan transform and alter objects with his powers, for example. The Oneirosphere can allow beings from someone's dream to escape and live inside of it, or it can cause multiple people's dreams or ideas to coalesce inside it and create a new being. If one of these beings, known as oneiroi, are strong enough they may be able to partially or fully manifest on Earth, although most people will be unable to see them under most circumstances, and their ability to influence the physical world may be limited as well.</p>
            <h2>Oneiromancers:</h2>
            <p>Some people are aware of the Oneirosphere and are able to use their minds to influence it and use it to benefit themselves, traditionally there are two kinds, <span class="b">Conjurers</span> and <span class="b">Summoners</span>. These names might sound like synonyms but they are drastically different.</p>
            <p><span class="b">Conjurers: </span>Conjurers have the ability to imagine an object, and use their psychic power to temporarily bring that imagined object into reality. This can be used to create tools, weapons, and magical items, although the Conjurer has to practice extensively for more complicated objects since they have to use a percentage of their focus to keep the object manifested.</p>
            <p><span class="b">Summoners: </span>As mentioned earlier, not all oneiroi are strong enough to physically manifest themselves or influence the world, however a summoner can make a deal or subjugate these oneiroi, and if they do they can use their psychic power to allow said oneiroi to do so and use their powers freely on Earth.</p>
            <p><span class="b">Hybrids: </span>A Hybrid is a new thing, it is a combination of an actual physical lifeform and an oneiros. There are 2 kinds, True Hybrids and False Hybrids, the former being the result of an oneiros and a physical lifeform having a kid, and the latter being the result of a physical lifeform absorbing and merging with an oneiros somehow. The powers of a hybrid depends on their oneiros half.</p>
            <p><span class="b">Outliers: </span>Outliers are people who influence the Oneirosphere in different ways then Conjurers and Summoners, and aren't Hybrids. Outliers are not new, however they weren't known about in recent history since Summoners and Conjurers had worked against them and oppressed them back in the day, however up until recently there haven't been many Oneiromancers at all so it didn't matter, although more are waking up lately and that includes Outliers. The powers of an Outlier, much like those of Hybrids, cannot be easily classified because it is a case by case basis.</p>
            <h2>The Big Secret: </h2>
            <p>As mentioned earlier, most of the supernatural aspects of DreamCrashers' world are unknown to ordinary people, otherwise the world is a lot like the real modern day world. This secret must be kept from most of humanity for one simple reason, the Oneirosphere reacts to the thoughts of every mind on Earth, and it's impossible to predict what would happen if everyone became aware of it, hence the mission of the DreamCrashers and people like them. There are those who wish to reveal the secret to the world for one reason or another, but most of the time they are either unaware of or dismissive of the potential consequence.</p>
