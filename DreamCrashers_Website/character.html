            <h2>Characters: </h2>
            <p>This section will list off some of the characters in DreamCrashers, like...</p>
            <p><span class="b">Ethan Sterling: </span>A young man who nearly died, but was saved when the oneiros Lumisara gave Ethan it's life force, giving him powers as a side effect. His powers are only active in the absence of daylight, which as far as his powers are concerned is not the same thing as sunlight. At night he may start losing control of himself as Lumisara's nightmare hunting instincts overwhelm him, if they do, or if he willingly chooses to, he can transform into a luminous version of himself, and can utilize several abilities in this state, including greatly enhanced physical capabilities and a magical healing factor. <span style="font-weight: 550;">Starlit eyes: </span>This ability gives Ethan the ability to see things normal people or even other psychically awakened people may not be able to, such as whether an oneiroi is hiding inside a person, he can also use the magical starlight emitted from his eyes to blind or harm enemies' minds or bodies. <span style="font-weight: 550;">Starlight Touch/Glow Up: </span>This allows Ethan to imbue ordinary objects with his starlight and improve them and make them magical until he releases the object or changes himself back to normal, due to the overlap between this ability and Eli's, it causes even more problems between them sometimes.</p>
            <p><span class="b">Eli: </span>Eli is something called a conjurer, which means he has the ability to imagine an object, and use his psychic power to temporarily bring that imagined object into reality. He uses this power to create weapons, tools, and gates for dream territories. His family has historically been one of conjurers, however Eli is the first one in generations to awaken to this power as the family had forgotten their history.</p>
            <p><span class="b">Quinn: </span>Quinn is Eli's chilhood friend and is a member of a historical family of summoners. Rather than simply making a deal or subjugating them, Quinn prefers to befriend her oneiroi. Like Eli, Quinn is the first summoner to awaken in generations for the same reason. Her oneiroi friends include Tanner, the scout squirrel; Pedro, the raccoon of protection; Mittens, the speedpanther; and Blizzard, the frostwing dragon. Additionally there are the Seven Parrots of Communication: Cookie, Pumpkin, Melon, Butter, Cola, Peppermint, and Candy.</p>
            <p><span class="b">Micheal: </span>The first member to join the DreamCrashers since Ethan and Quinn persuaded Eli to form the group. He was running from an oneiros known as the Pursuer because he possessed a mysterious box the creature wanted. He ran into Ethan while trying to escape it, who was able to see the creature because of his powers. However it was daytime so Ethan couldn't fight it, instead they ran from it in Ethan's car until nightfall. When Ethan destroyed the pursuer, Micheal's box opened and revealed the beast's heart, which contained most of it's strength. The heart merged with Micheal which gave him the power to change into a form resembling the pursuer, however due to it's ferocity it is even harder to control than Ethan's powers. He joined the DreamCrashers so he could be kept in check and so Ethan can help him control himself.</p>
            <p><span class="b">The Boogieman: </span>The darker half of the Sandman, who he was split apart from a long time ago, he rules over nightmares and fear, however he is the one who brought the Dreamcrashers together by talking to Ethan the night before he met Eli and Quinn. Unlike other oneiroi, he is powerful enough to not only manifest on Earth, but do so in a human form that can be seen by anyone, he has used this to influence society by making deals with high class individuals. Although he started out as the evil side of the Sandman, since splitting from him he has realized his purpose and works to assist the DreamCrashers to the best of his ability in hopes of preventing the release of the big secret. He, nor anyone else has actually heard from the Sandman in a long time, he is assumed missing. He changed his name in the 70s because he has an obsession with disco music for some reason. He cannot directly confront humans with violence due to Sandman putting that restriction on him, which is why he sneakily influenced Ethan to start the DreamCrashers.</p>
            <p><span class="b">Lynchpin: </span>A mysterious figure who works to enslave humanity, they are working with oneiroi that have become disloyal to the Boogieman, which has angered him immensely.</p>
